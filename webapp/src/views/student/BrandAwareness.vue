        <hr />
        <b>1. Know yourself</b>
        <p>Spend some time being introspective and design a brand for yourself that you’d be comfortable advertising in every interaction. The more you learn about yourself, the better you can manage your time and focus on developing your strengths. There is something that only people like you can provide to a team. Find out what that special something is.</p>

        <b>2. Know what you want to be known for</b>
        <p>Once you gain a solid grasp on your brand, visualize how you want to be seen in the future. This will give you an idea of how you should expend your efforts to become the professional that you hope to be.</p>

        <b>3. Keep up with how people see you</b>
        <p>Stay up to date with how others perceive you. If your brand is an accurate representation of yourself, other people should see you in a similar way that you see yourself.</p>

        <b>4. Focus on how your brand is useful to others</b>
        <p>A brand is only as useful to you as it is to everyone else. Make sure that people see your brand and feel like they need to have you on their team.</p>

        <b>5. Be professionally active on social media</b>
        <p>Once you’ve decided on how you want to be viewed, make use of social media to reach as many people as possible. A good way to do this is to have a robust LinkedIn account and to stay active.</p>
